# @aws-blocks/blocks

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- d4b32f2: Add `README.md` and `DESIGN.md` to `@aws-blocks/create-block` and ship them in the published package (`files`), matching the first-party package convention.
  
  Tidy two `extract-ts-types` test nits (test/comment only, no runtime change): replace a redundant re-assert with a direct check of the documented lingering-bare-key behavior, and link the array/tuple & nested-destructuring boundary to its tracking issue (#552).
- Updated dependencies [d4b32f2]
  - @aws-blocks/core@0.5.1

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- d7312f9: Make observability **compute-driven** so it composes correctly once an app has more than one compute. Logging, tracing, and the dashboard now key off compute state rather than off the Logger / Tracer / Dashboard blocks poking a single implicit compute.
  
  **Logging is always on; retention is a compute-level setting.** Every compute captures stdout to its own log group unconditionally — there is no "enable logging" step. The retention of that group is set per compute via a new `logRetention` prop on `LambdaCompute` (`@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute`), falling back to `defaults.logRetention`. Log **level** is purely per-instance runtime behavior: set it via a `Logger`'s `level` option (default `'info'`). There is no app-wide log-level default and no `LOG_LEVEL` env var.
  
  **Tracing is presence-gated.** Creating any `Tracer` in the app now enables X-Ray on **every** compute (X-Ray provisions real, costed infrastructure, so it stays off until the app opts in by constructing a Tracer). This replaces the previous model where a Tracer turned on tracing for one implicit compute. `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` adds `registerTracer()` (records Tracer presence) and `finalizeTracing()` (enables tracing on all computes at finalize); `create()` runs it before finalizing dashboards. `Compute.enableTracing()` is now idempotent.
  
  **The dashboard is organized by compute, with display toggles.** `DashboardOptions` gains `logs?: boolean` (default `true`) and `traces?: boolean` (default `true`) — app-wide display toggles applied uniformly to every compute section. `logs:false` hides the (always-captured) logs section; `traces:false` hides traces even when tracing is enabled.
  
  The dashboard covers **every** compute in the app (resolved at finalize, so construction order never matters). Each compute renders a health section always, a logs section (unless `logs:false`), and a traces section only when tracing is enabled on it (unless `traces:false`). Metrics remain app-scoped and are passed explicitly. No `computes` selector is exposed yet — it would leak the internal `Compute` type before customers can construct a compute; it arrives with the multi-compute surface.
  
  **⚠️ Behavior / API changes:**
  
  - **`Logger` no longer reconfigures log retention.** The CDK `Logger` is now a no-op placeholder (logging is always on and retention moved to the compute). The `retention` option was removed from `LoggingOptions`; set `logRetention` on the compute instead.
  - **A `Tracer` now enables X-Ray on all computes, not one.** Any Tracer in the app turns on tracing fleet-wide.
  - **`Logger` no longer reads the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.** Log level is set solely via the per-`Logger` `level` option (default `'info'`); the previously supported `LOG_LEVEL` env-var override has been removed, and Blocks stamps no app-wide log-level config. `BlocksDefaults` has no `logLevel` field.
  - **Removed the deprecated `LoggerBBRef` / `TracerBBRef` dashboard types.** They were no longer consumed — the dashboard reads compute state directly. Loggers and Tracers were never passed to the Dashboard in this model.

### Patch Changes

- 7b86b8e: fix(auth-oidc): make `cognitoFederated()` deployable by registering the IdP via a deploy-time custom resource
  
  `@aws-blocks/bb-app-setting` now also exports `SECRETS_BULK_CONSTRUCT_ID` — the
  construct id of the shared per-stack secret-init custom resource — so sibling
  blocks can order a resource after the SecureString values are written without
  hard-coding the string. `bb-auth-oidc`'s IdP-registration custom resource uses
  it to take an explicit dependency on that resource (compile-time coupling, so a
  rename can't silently break the ordering guarantee).
  
  `cognitoFederated()` previously produced a CloudFormation template that always
  failed to deploy (#447). It registered the federated identity provider with a
  native `AWS::Cognito::UserPoolIdentityProvider` resource, writing the IdP
  `client_id` / `client_secret` into `ProviderDetails` as
  `{{resolve:ssm-secure:...}}` dynamic references. CloudFormation only permits
  `ssm-secure` references on a small allowlist of properties that excludes
  `ProviderDetails`, so `cdk synth` succeeded but every deploy failed at
  change-set creation — before any resource was created — leaving the stack in
  `REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS` with `SSM Secure reference is not supported in [...ProviderDetails...]`.
  
  The IdP is now registered by a **deploy-time custom resource**: a small
  Lambda-backed provider reads and decrypts the IdP credential SecureString
  parameters via the SDK at deploy time and calls Cognito's
  `CreateIdentityProvider` / `UpdateIdentityProvider` / `DeleteIdentityProvider`.
  Only the parameter *names* cross into the CloudFormation template — the secret
  values never appear in it. The handler's role is least-privilege: scoped to
  `cognito-idp:{Create,Update,Delete}IdentityProvider` on the pool ARN,
  `ssm:GetParameter` on the specific parameter ARNs, and `kms:Decrypt` conditioned
  on `kms:ViaService = ssm.<region>`.
  
  A `secret: true` `AppSetting` is an SSM SecureString at `/<fullId>` (not an AWS
  Secrets Manager entry — the `blocks secret` CLI does not apply). Set its value by
  writing the SecureString directly (`aws ssm put-parameter … --type SecureString
  --overwrite`) or via the `AppSetting` runtime `put()`. Because the credentials
  are read at deploy time and are not stack properties, the custom resource
  re-reads SSM on every `cdk deploy`, so a credential set or rotation takes effect
  on the next deploy. A synth-time check rejects two providers configured with the
  same `identityProvider`.
  
  Verified end-to-end against a real account: `cdk deploy` succeeds (no change-set
  rejection) and the identity provider is created on the User Pool, including the
  path where a real `AppSetting(secret: true)` provisions the SecureString during
  the same deploy.
  
  This is a `minor` bump for `@aws-blocks/bb-auth-oidc` (pre-1.0 minor = a behavior
  change): the synthesized template for a `cognitoFederated()` provider no longer
  contains a native `UserPoolIdentityProvider` resource — the IdP is now a custom
  resource — so anyone asserting on that resource in a snapshot will see a diff.
  The public API is unchanged.
- 4342149: fix(bb-dashboard): depend on `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute@^0.4.0`
  
  `bb-dashboard` declared its `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute` devDependency as
  `^0.3.0`, which excludes the current workspace version (`0.4.0`). npm therefore
  installed the published `0.3.0` tarball into `bb-dashboard` instead of linking
  the local workspace, and two failures followed: the root `package-lock.json`
  fell out of sync (breaking `npm ci` repo-wide), and `bb-dashboard`'s CDK test
  crashed with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` importing
  `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute/cdk` — a subpath the old `0.3.0` did not export.
  
  Aligning the range to `^0.4.0` links the local workspace (which exports
  `./cdk`), fixing both. Dev-dependency-only; no runtime or API change.
- e2c3c62: fix(bb-distributed-data): re-run the DSQL role grant when the app's IAM role is replaced
  
  `DistributedDatabase` maps the app's IAM role ARN to a DSQL database role with
  `AWS IAM GRANT`. The migration/provisioning CustomResource is documented as running
  on every deploy so the mapping "stays in sync if the app Lambda's IAM role is
  recreated", but its properties were `{ migrationsHash, dbRole }` only — the role ARN
  reached the Lambda as an environment variable and nothing else.
  
  CloudFormation re-invokes a CustomResource only when its **properties** change. When
  an IAM role replacement changed the ARN while migrations stayed the same, both
  properties were unchanged, so CloudFormation skipped the resource entirely. The
  Lambda's `APP_ROLE_ARN` env var was updated but the function was never called, leaving
  the DSQL grant pointing at the old, deleted ARN. Every query then failed with SQLSTATE
  `28000` (`invalid_authorization_specification`, "unable to accept connection, access
  denied") while the deploy itself reported success and the IAM policy still showed a
  correct `dsql:DbConnect` — the breakage lived in DSQL's internal role mapping, which is
  invisible from the CloudFormation layer.
  
  `appRoleArn` is now a CustomResource property, so a role replacement re-invokes the
  resource and `provisionAppRole()` re-issues the grant as part of the deploy. The value
  is a CDK token, so it differs only when the role is genuinely replaced — this does not
  force the resource to run on every deploy.
  
  This was latent from the initial version and stayed dormant while each Lambda kept its
  own stable execution role. It surfaced once the shared execution role landed (#320,
  #341): upgrading `@aws-blocks/core` across that range replaces the per-Lambda
  `HandlerServiceRole` with the shared `BlocksRole`, which is exactly the role-ARN change
  that the CustomResource failed to notice.
  
  `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets a `patch` bump because it re-exports `bb-distributed-data`
  (satisfies the umbrella publish guard); no umbrella source changed.
  
  Fixes #556.
- f552ebe: fix(core): follow a factory-returned, destructured `ApiNamespace` when extracting spec schemas (#444)
  
  `blocks-generate-spec` lost the TypeScript parameter/result schemas for an
  `ApiNamespace` that was constructed inside a factory, returned as a property,
  destructured, and then exported (e.g. `const { api } = new Factory().build()`).
  The extractor's indirect pass only handled a simple identifier binding
  (`const api = …`), so a destructured binding fell through and the method's
  schema was attributed to a bare, unqualified key — which, under a method-name
  collision with another namespace, cross-assigned or degraded to
  `{ "type": "unknown" }` (the same class of bug as #445, via the factory path).
  
  The indirect pass now also handles **object binding patterns**: for each
  destructured binding it resolves the property's type off the initializer and
  extracts the methods keyed by the local (exported) namespace name — so a
  factory-returned namespace keys qualified (`api.method`) exactly like a
  directly-constructed one, and same-named methods across namespaces no longer
  collide. Renamed bindings (`const { foo: bar } = …`) read the correct property.
- 9aa0814: `blocks-generate-spec`: stop cross-assigning schemas between namespaces that share a method name.
  
  The TypeScript type extractor keyed method schemas by the bare method name, so when two `ApiNamespace`s each exposed an operation with the same name (e.g. `widgets.create` and `subscriptions.create`), one namespace's parameter/result schemas silently overwrote the other's in the generated OpenRPC document — producing incorrect client types. Method schemas are now keyed by the namespace-qualified name (`namespace.method`), matching how the spec routes operations; the consumer falls back to the bare name for methods the extractor couldn't attribute to a namespace, so no previously-working case regresses.
- 81609a8: `KVStore.put`: allow `ifNotExists` and `ifValueEquals` to compose.
  
  Previously the two conditional-write options were mutually exclusive — the AWS runtime silently ignored `ifValueEquals` when `ifNotExists` was also set, and the mock rejected the write outright, so passing both was unusable (and the two layers diverged). They now compose with **OR**: the write succeeds when the key is absent **or** its current value matches, and fails only when the key exists **and** the value differs. This is the optimistic "create it, or update it only if unchanged" pattern (`attribute_not_exists(pk) OR value = :expected`). Each option used alone is unchanged.
- 5eee114: Add npm keywords for discoverability via `npm search keywords:aws-blocks`
  
  Every published package now carries an npm `keywords` array: the shared `aws-blocks`
  discovery tag plus 2–5 functional keywords describing the package's domain and the
  AWS services it uses (e.g. `realtime`, `websocket`, `pubsub` for `bb-realtime`;
  `ci-cd`, `pipelines`, `deployment` for `pipeline`). Metadata only — no runtime,
  API, or behavior change.
- 21443ba: fix(data): map optimistic-concurrency conflicts to JSON-RPC 409 (Conflict) instead of 500
  
  Optimistic-concurrency / conditional-write conflicts now surface to clients as
  JSON-RPC error **code 409 (Conflict)** instead of a generic **500**. Previously
  these conflicts were thrown as plain named `Error`s (or re-thrown raw driver
  errors), and the JSON-RPC serializer maps any non-`ApiError` to 500 — so a
  routine, expected conflict was indistinguishable from an internal server error.
  
  Each affected conflict is now an `ApiError` with `status: 409`, so on the client
  `error.status === 409`. The structured `error.name` is preserved end-to-end, so
  `isBlocksError(e, ...)` keeps matching by name on both server and client, and the
  existing typed error constants are unchanged:
  
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-kv-store` — a failed `ifNotExists` / `ifExists` /
    `ifValueEquals` write or delete (`KVStoreErrors.ConditionalCheckFailed`). The
    AWS runtime now also normalizes DynamoDB's raw `ConditionalCheckFailedException`
    on both `put` and `delete`, matching the mock.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-table` — a failed `ifNotExists` / `ifExists` /
    `ifFieldEquals` condition (`DistributedTableErrors.ConditionalCheckFailed`),
    in both mock and AWS `put`/`delete`.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-data` — a DSQL serialization failure / OCC
    conflict, SQLSTATE `40001` (`DistributedDatabaseErrors.SerializationFailure`),
    in both the mock and real engines.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-data` — a serializable-isolation conflict, SQLSTATE `40001`
    (`DatabaseErrors.SerializationFailure`), across the PGlite, pg-client, and
    Data API engines.
  
  The `retriable` flag is scoped to genuine optimistic-lock conflicts: it is
  `true` for value/field-equals conflicts (`ifValueEquals` / `ifFieldEquals`) and
  the 40001 serialization failures, and omitted/`false` for existence/uniqueness
  assertions (`ifNotExists`, `ifExists`), where a blind identical retry would fail
  identically. Status (409) and `error.name` are unchanged in every case.
  
  This is a `minor` bump. Every package here is pre-1.0, where `minor` is this
  repo's signal for a change that can alter existing behavior: callers that
  branched on `error.status === 500` for these conflicts (or on the JSON-RPC error
  code) will now see `409`. Code that matches conflicts by name via
  `isBlocksError` — the documented pattern — is unaffected.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core` and `@aws-blocks/blocks` get a `patch` bump for a docs-only
  change: a clarifying sentence was added to the `ApiError.retriable` JSDoc
  (no behavior or API change).
- acd1628: Share the RawRoute registry across duplicate copies of `@aws-blocks/core` so routes registered through one copy are dispatched (and synthesized into CloudFront behaviors) by another, instead of silently returning 404. Unmatched routes now log a diagnostic, and a duplicate core copy warns once.
- 6496713: Simplify VPC implementation: replace `registerVpcEndpoint` (instanceof-based) with two explicit methods (`registerVpcGatewayEndpoint` / `registerVpcInterfaceEndpoint`), simplify `BlocksVpcOptions` to `{ network, subnets?, provisionEndpoints? }`, and strip persistent test VPC to bare minimum.
- bd67438: feat(auth-oidc): let `stubIdp()` declare test users inline
  
  `stubIdp()` gains an optional `users?: StubUser[]`. Previously the stub IdP's
  identity directory could only be seeded from a `users.json` file in the mock
  data dir (with a single default user otherwise), so declaring test users meant
  committing/gitignoring a data file. Inline `users` are now the authoritative
  directory for the login screen and the `users` handed to `onAuthorize`, taking
  precedence over `users.json` and the built-in default. Omitting it is unchanged
  (file → default fallback), so existing apps and the AWS runtime are unaffected.
- a47d71c: fix(data): map duplicate-key unique-constraint violations to JSON-RPC 409 (Conflict) instead of 500
  
  A duplicate-key / unique-constraint violation (SQLSTATE `23505`,
  `UniqueConstraintViolation`) now surfaces to clients as JSON-RPC error
  **code 409 (Conflict)** instead of a generic **500**. Previously the engine
  translators set `error.name` on the raw driver error and re-threw a plain named
  `Error`; the JSON-RPC serializer maps any non-`ApiError` to 500, so a routine,
  expected duplicate-key conflict was indistinguishable from an internal server
  error. This mirrors the `40001`/OCC → 409 mapping already established for these
  Blocks.
  
  Each affected conflict is now an `ApiError` with `status: 409`, so on the client
  `error.status === 409`. The structured `error.name` is preserved end-to-end, so
  `isBlocksError(e, DatabaseErrors.UniqueConstraintViolation)` (and the
  `DistributedDatabaseErrors` equivalent) keeps matching by name on both server and
  client; the typed error constants are unchanged.
  
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-data` — a duplicate-key violation (SQLSTATE `23505`,
    `DatabaseErrors.UniqueConstraintViolation`) across the PGlite, pg-client, and
    Data API engines (both the SQLState-parsed and message-matched Data API paths),
    routed through a shared `uniqueConstraintConflict()` helper.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-data` — a DSQL duplicate-key violation (SQLSTATE
    `23505`, `DistributedDatabaseErrors.UniqueConstraintViolation`) in
    `translateDsqlError`, in both the mock and real engines.
  
  The conflict is **not** flagged `retriable`: a duplicate key is deterministic, so
  a blind retry of the same insert fails identically (unlike the `40001`
  serialization failures, which stay retriable). The client-visible message is a
  fixed, stable string; the raw driver text (which can name columns / constraints)
  is retained only as `cause` for server-side diagnostics. Genuine infrastructure
  errors (`ConnectionFailed`, `QueryFailed`) are unchanged and correctly stay 500,
  and the `SerializationFailure`/OCC paths are untouched.
  
  This is a `minor` bump. Both data packages are pre-1.0, where `minor` is this
  repo's signal for a change that can alter existing behavior: callers that
  branched on `error.status === 500` for these conflicts (or on the JSON-RPC error
  code) will now see `409`. Code that matches conflicts by name via
  `isBlocksError` — the documented pattern — is unaffected.
  
  `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets a `patch` bump because it re-exports `bb-data` and
  `bb-distributed-data` (satisfies the umbrella publish guard); no umbrella source
  changed.
  
  Fixes #508.
- 0385f7e: `useChat`: widen `UseChatOptions.api.sendMessage` and `resume` return types from `Promise<void>` to `Promise<unknown>`.
  
  The natural backend methods return objects (`agent.stream()` → `{ channelId }`, `resume` wrappers → `{ ok: true }`), but `Promise<{ channelId }>` is not assignable to `Promise<void>` (TS2322), which forced customers into an await-and-discard wrapper. `useChat` awaits both calls only for completion and discards the resolved value, so `Promise<unknown>` — assignable-from both object results and `void` — lets natural-shape backends wire up directly while existing `void`-returning backends keep compiling. Type-only change; no runtime behavior change.
- daf523a: docs(bb-agent): add a concrete React `useChat` example
  
  The `useChat` docs only showed the framework-agnostic callback form and warned
  that it is "a factory function, not a React hook — call it once, not on every
  render," without demonstrating the fix. Added a primary React example that holds
  the instance in a `useRef` (created lazily so it survives re-renders), bridges
  `onMessagesChange` / `onLoadingChange` into `useState`, cleans up with
  `chat.destroy()` on unmount, and renders messages plus a send handler — directly
  resolving the "call once" footgun. Included a one-line Next.js note (same
  component, keep the `'use client'` directive) and kept the existing
  framework-agnostic example as the baseline.
- 6496713: fix(bb-data): place shared-VPC Aurora in the subnets the VPC actually has
  
  When `Database` runs inside a bring-your-own VPC, its Aurora cluster was pinned
  to `PRIVATE_ISOLATED` subnets. The VPC in every docs example
  (`new ec2.Vpc(app, 'AppVpc', { maxAzs: 2, natGateways: 1 })`) has no isolated
  tier, so following the documented setup and adding a `Database` failed synth
  with "no isolated subnet groups in this VPC."
  
  Aurora is reached over the RDS Data API (HTTPS via the interface endpoint), not
  a raw Postgres socket, so the placement tier does not affect reachability — it
  only has to be a tier the VPC actually has. The shared-VPC path now prefers the
  isolated tier when the VPC has one (keeping the DB off any NAT path) and falls
  back to `PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS` otherwise, via the VPC context's `selectSubnets`.
  The standalone path is unchanged — it still builds its own VPC with a dedicated
  isolated tier.
  
  This is a `patch` bump: pre-1.0, where this repo reserves `minor` for breaking
  changes. The behavior change only affects the shared-VPC path that previously
  failed synth, so it is strictly a fix. The umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets
  the same bump because it re-exports `Database`.
  
  Also adds `Template.fromStack` unit coverage for `finalizeVpc` in
  `@aws-blocks/core` — asserting the provisioned `AWS::EC2::VPCEndpoint` set, the
  gateway/interface dedup, and the always-on CloudWatch Logs + SSM endpoints —
  which previously had no test exercising the provisioning path.
- 6496713: feat(core): constructor-forced VPC requirements, lazy VPC, and Database subnet control
  
  Continues the VPC review follow-ups (net-new, unreleased VPC feature).
  
  **Building Blocks declare VPC requirements via the constructor, not a method.**
  `BuildingBlockScope` is no longer abstract: its constructor takes the block's VPC
  requirements (a value, or a callback for values that depend on `fullId`) and
  registers them in a central per-stack registry. This keeps the compile-time
  forcing the previous `abstract getVpcRequirements()` provided — a block can't
  silently omit its requirements — without a standing method on every subclass, and
  gives the framework one place to read, deduplicate, and answer "does anything here
  need a VPC?". All Building Blocks were migrated to pass requirements to `super()`.
  
  **VPC is now a derived resource, not a hard prerequisite.** A block that cannot
  function without a VPC declares `requiresVpc: true`; when one is needed and the
  customer didn't bring their own, Blocks lazily creates a single shared VPC
  (generalizing the create-if-absent behavior `bb-data` already used for Aurora) and
  emits a notice about the NAT cost. Setting `defaults.vpc = { network }` remains the
  bring-your-own override.
  
  **`Database` accepts an optional `subnets` placement.** A CDK-free mirror of
  `ec2.SubnetSelection` (tier as a string, subnets by id) lets you steer where the
  Aurora cluster lands — for a bring-your-own VPC that lacks an isolated tier, or a
  compliance requirement to use specific subnets. Omit it to keep the default
  (prefer isolated, fall back to `private-with-egress`).
- 6496713: fix(core): harden VPC integration — scoped endpoint SG, runtime-subnet validation, instructive subnet errors
  
  Second-pass hardening of VPC support based on review feedback.
  
  **Interface endpoints are no longer reachable from the whole VPC.** They now get
  a dedicated security group that allows 443 only from the Blocks Lambda SG, and
  the endpoints are created with `open: false` to suppress CDK's default
  "allow 443 from the entire VPC CIDR" rule. On a bring-your-own VPC this stops
  unrelated workloads from reaching every Blocks interface endpoint.
  
  **`VpcRequirements.subnetRole` is replaced by `requiresEgress`.** The old field
  was declared but never consumed. `requiresEgress` expresses a real, validated
  capability: whether the BB's parent runtime (the shared handler Lambda) must be
  able to reach the internet. `finalizeVpc` validates it against the runtime's
  actual placement and fails synth with an actionable message on a mismatch — it
  never relocates the runtime (that's the customer's explicit choice).
  `bb-distributed-data` (DSQL) declares `requiresEgress: true`, turning a
  previously silent runtime failure (DSQL in isolated subnets deploys clean, then
  every call times out) into a build-time error.
  
  **`VpcContext.selectSubnets` is now instructive.** It takes the requesting BB and
  verifies the VPC actually has the requested subnet tier, throwing a BB-named,
  actionable error instead of the opaque CDK "no subnet groups" error. It accepts
  an explicit `{ fallback }` so a BB can opt into graceful degradation (e.g. Aurora
  over the Data API works from `private-with-egress` when there is no isolated
  tier); the downgrade is never silent. `bb-data` uses this.
  
  **Other fixes:** Lambda placement now fails fast with an actionable error when a
  VPC has no private-with-egress tier and none was specified; `bb-data` drops its
  unused 5432 ingress rule (Aurora is reached over the RDS Data API, not a socket);
  removed `any` casts from the Lambda props and endpoint/CIDR handling; de-duplicated
  the VPC/non-VPC branches in `BlocksStack`.
  
  All pre-1.0 `patch` bumps — no breaking changes to shipped, consumed API
  (`subnetRole` had no consumers). The umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` re-exports the
  affected types.
- 6496713: fix(core): VPC review follow-ups — egress capability, endpoint trim, S3 gateway
  
  Refines VPC support based on review feedback (all changes to the net-new,
  unreleased VPC feature).
  
  **`VpcRequirements.runtimeSubnet` becomes `requiresEgress?: boolean`.** A BB's
  runtime need is a capability ("my code must reach the internet"), not a specific
  subnet tier. Modeling it as a single role wrongly rejected a valid placement
  (e.g. a BB needing egress placed in a `public` subnet). `finalizeVpc` now resolves
  whether the runtime's placement actually provides egress — from the selected
  subnets, not a guessed role — and validates `requiresEgress` against that. When
  egress can't be determined (e.g. an imported VPC whose subnets aren't known at
  synth) it warns rather than fabricating a pass/fail. `bb-distributed-data` (DSQL)
  now declares `requiresEgress: true`.
  
  **SSM interface endpoint is no longer always provisioned.** Only `AppSetting` and
  the auth blocks (which compose `AppSetting`) use SSM, so it now flows from Building
  Block requirements. An app that uses neither no longer pays for an unused interface
  endpoint. CloudWatch Logs stays always-on (every in-VPC Lambda needs it for log
  delivery).
  
  **The S3 gateway endpoint is now always provisioned.** The runtime pulls config,
  secrets, and migrations from S3 at cold start. Gateway endpoints are free
  (route-table entries, no ENI), so this closes a real cold-start access gap at no
  cost.
- 302090a: Local dev server: handle raw-socket errors during the WebSocket upgrade instead of crashing.
  
  The `upgrade` handlers routed the HTTP upgrade without attaching an `'error'` listener to the raw `net.Socket` first. A stale WebSocket client that reset its connection inside the upgrade window emitted ECONNRESET on a socket with no handler, so Node's default unhandled-`'error'` behaviour killed the dev server process right after port bind. Both upgrade paths now attach `socket.on('error', () => socket.destroy())` as their first statement, the HTTP server answers malformed/aborted requests via a `clientError` handler, and the `noServer` `WebSocketServer` logs server-level errors rather than throwing. The fix is scoped to the vulnerable socket — a genuine error anywhere else still crashes as before.

### Minor Changes

- 9111c0c: feat(bb-agent): cap model and tool calls per turn to bound runaway cost
  
  Adds two per-turn safety caps to `AgentConfig`, both defaulting to `20`:
  
  - `maxLlmCalls` — the maximum number of model (Bedrock) invocations in a single
    turn. Model calls are the unit Bedrock bills for, so this is the most direct
    guard against an agent that loops its reason→act cycle indefinitely; because
    every tool round needs a model call, it transitively bounds tool loops too.
  - `maxToolIterations` — the maximum number of tool calls in a single turn
    (parallel tool batches count each call).
  
  When either cap is exceeded the turn is cancelled and the client receives an
  `error` chunk (so `complete()` rejects) instead of `done`. Both caps are
  enforced with in-loop Strands hooks, so they work identically on every compute
  target with no cross-process signaling.
  
  Behavior change: turns are now capped at 20 model calls and 20 tool calls by
  default. This is generous for a single turn, but agents that legitimately reason
  over many steps or chain many tools must raise `maxLlmCalls` /
  `maxToolIterations`, or set a cap to `false` to disable it. The caps bound call
  *count*, not tokens or wall-clock — pair them with a billing or CloudWatch alarm
  on Bedrock spend for real cost protection.
  
  This is a `minor` bump. Every package here is pre-1.0, where `minor` is this
  repo's signal for a change that can alter existing behavior. The two options are
  new and optional and there's an opt-out (raise the cap, or set it to `false`),
  but the new default changes the runtime behavior of every existing agent — a
  turn that legitimately exceeds 20 model or tool calls is now cut off unless the
  customer opts out — so it ships as `minor` rather than `patch` to surface that
  clearly. The counts cover a whole logical turn: they live in the agent's
  persisted session state, and the per-turn reset is keyed on a turn id applied
  lazily (the session snapshot is restored inside `stream()`, so an up-front reset
  would be overwritten and the budget would leak into the next turn), so a turn
  paused on a human-in-the-loop interrupt keeps its budget across `resume()` while
  a new message always starts a fresh one. A cap value must be a positive integer
  or `false`; anything else throws `InvalidModelConfigException`. The umbrella
  `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets the same bump because it re-exports `AgentConfig`.
- c45eb92: Extend stack-wide `BlocksDefaults` (introduced in the Infrastructure Options work) with three additive fields, and adopt them across the Blocks-managed infrastructure. Each field is read independently via `option ?? scope.defaults.field` — a per-block option always wins, and no field is derived from another.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now adds to `BlocksDefaults` (and both `BlocksPresets`):
  
  - `logRetention: RetentionDays` — how long Blocks-managed CloudWatch log groups keep events. Preset sandbox `ONE_WEEK`, production `ONE_YEAR`.
  - `throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit }` — request-rate limits applied to every Blocks API Gateway stage. Preset sandbox `200 / 400`, production `1000 / 2000`.
  - `accessLogging: boolean` — structured JSON access logs on every Blocks API Gateway stage. **Off by default in both presets** (opt-in), because enabling it mutates the account/region-level API Gateway CloudWatch role singleton.
  
  Also newly exported from `@aws-blocks/core/cdk`: the `BlocksThrottling` type and `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` (provisions the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role once per stack). `Scope` gains a `handlerLogGroup` getter for the shared handler log group.
  
  **Log retention** — Blocks-managed log groups now follow `defaults.logRetention` instead of AWS's infinite default: the shared handler Lambda (now owned by `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` as `scope.handlerLogGroup`), the `bb-distributed-table` GSI-manager Lambdas, the `bb-distributed-data` DSQL migration Lambda, the `bb-data` Aurora migration Lambda, and the `bb-app-setting` secret-init Lambda. `bb-logger` reconfigures the shared handler group's retention — **only when an explicit per-Logger `retention` is set** (a bare `Logger` no longer writes it back, so it can't clobber another Logger's value) — rather than creating its own `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group. (Note: the framework `custom-resources.Provider` Lambdas these BBs wrap still use AWS's default retention — the L2 `Provider` exposes no log-group/retention override.)
  
  **Throttling** — applied to the core REST API stage and the `bb-realtime` WebSocket stage. On a WebSocket stage the throttle unit is messages/second across the connection.
  
  **Access logging** — when enabled, each stage writes structured JSON access logs to a dedicated CloudWatch log group (retention = `defaults.logRetention`, removal policy = `defaults.removalPolicy` so production **RETAIN**s the audit trail on teardown). The account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role is provisioned once per stack and shared across stages.
  
  **⚠️ Behavior changes on upgrade:**
  - **Throttling now caps the core REST API and WebSocket stages.** Before this change these stages had no stage-level throttle (they ran at the API Gateway account default, ~10k rps). After upgrade, sandbox is capped at 200 rps / 400 burst and production at 1000 rps / 2000 burst. Apps serving above the production ceiling will see `429`s — raise it with a per-stack `throttling` override (`defaults: { ...BlocksPresets.production, throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit } }`).
  - **The shared handler Lambda log group changes.** The handler previously logged to Lambda's auto-created `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group (infinite retention); it now logs to a framework-owned group with the default retention. On upgrade the old auto group is left orphaned in CloudWatch (unmanaged, still infinite) — delete it manually if you want its history/cost gone. Likewise a `bb-logger`-created retention group from a prior version is replaced.
  - **Access logging** is **opt-in (off in both presets)**. When enabled it requires the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role — an account/region-level singleton, so enabling it is safe for **one Blocks stack per region** (see `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` for the multi-stack teardown caveat). It defaults off (rather than on for production) so an upgrade never mutates that account-wide singleton without an explicit opt-in.
  - **`BlocksDefaults` gains three required fields** (`logRetention`, `throttling`, `accessLogging`). Apps that spread a `BlocksPresets` preset (the documented path) are unaffected; code that hand-rolls a literal `BlocksDefaults` object will need to add the new fields to compile.
  
  `bb-dashboard` now points its log widgets at the framework-owned handler log
  group (`scope.handlerLogGroup.logGroupName`) instead of reconstructing
  `/aws/lambda/<fn>` — the handler now writes to a dedicated group with a
  CDK-generated name, so the old convention would leave the "Recent Errors" /
  "Log Volume" widgets querying an empty group.
  
  Hosting adoption of these defaults (SSR REST API + compute log groups) ships in a separate change.
- 4a830a6: feat: route event-block resources to their resolved compute
  
  AsyncJob, CronJob, and Realtime now attach their compute-bound resources to a
  compute resolved at synth rather than the stack's shared handler:
  
  - AsyncJob attaches its SQS event source to the resolved compute's function;
  - CronJob points its EventBridge Scheduler target at the resolved compute's function;
  - Realtime binds its shared WebSocket API integrations to the stack's **default**
    compute (its routes are a stack-level singleton) and grants `postToConnection`
    to the shared execution role, so `publish()` works from any compute.
  
  Each block requires a Lambda compute today and fails at synth with a typed
  `UnsupportedCompute` error (assertable via `isBlocksError`) on any other type.
  The check uses a duplicate-copy-safe brand (`LambdaCompute.isLambdaCompute`,
  backed by a `Symbol.for` marker) instead of `instanceof`, so it does not misfire
  when two copies of `bb-lambda-compute` resolve in one dependency tree.
  
  On the default single-Lambda setup the resolved/default compute is the stack's
  default, whose function is the shared handler — so this is non-breaking with no
  change to synthesized infrastructure. AsyncJob also grants SQS send to the shared
  execution role rather than the handler directly.
  
  New public surface (hence `minor`):
  
  - `@aws-blocks/core` exports `blocksError(name, message)` (the producer half of
    the `isBlocksError` contract) and `sanitizeConfigKey(id)` from `./bb-utils`
    (the single env-var-key sanitizer both config writers and runtime readers use).
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute` adds a `./cdk` subpath exposing the CDK-typed
    `LambdaCompute` and its `LambdaCompute.isLambdaCompute` guard.
  - `bb-async-job` / `bb-cron-job` / `bb-realtime` add an `UnsupportedCompute`
    error member.
  
  `@aws-blocks/bb-agent` builds AsyncJob and Realtime internally, so its CDK test
  moves onto the `BlocksStack.create` harness instead of a handler-only stub.
  Test-only change — no runtime behavior change to the Agent.
- f2f186c: fix(hosting): DeleteOldBuilds no longer expires the build that is currently served (#480)
  
  The `DeleteOldBuilds` S3 lifecycle rule expired every object under `builds/`
  after `buildRetentionDays` (default 30), including the build that CloudFront KVS
  `meta.b` currently points to. An app that did not deploy within the retention
  window had its live build's objects expired out from under an otherwise-healthy
  stack — the router kept rewriting to the now-empty prefix, so every static path
  returned 403 (hosting ≤ 0.1.4) or 404 (≥ 0.1.5) while the API path stayed 200.
  Recovery required a redeploy.
  
  **Fix.** The lifecycle rule now matches only objects tagged
  `aws-blocks:build-state=superseded`. At the KVS cutover, after the pointer flips
  to the new build, the cutover handler tags the *outgoing* build's objects
  superseded (best-effort; list + tag/untag only — the handler is granted **no** S3
  delete-object permission). The live build is never tagged, so it is never expired,
  regardless of deploy cadence. Superseded builds are still cleaned up after
  `buildRetentionDays`. S3 lifecycle `TagFilters` are inclusion-only (there is no
  "NOT tagged" predicate), which is why the superseded build is tagged rather than
  the live build excluded.
  
  **Rollback-safety hardening.** The same cutover also *clears* the build-state tag
  on the *incoming* build's objects, symmetric to tagging the outgoing one. Without
  this, a rollback that re-points `meta.b` back to a retained build that was tagged
  superseded by an earlier cutover would hand the now-live build to
  `DeleteOldBuilds` — #480 again. Clearing is best-effort and uses
  `s3:DeleteObjectTagging` (tags only, never objects).
  
  **`buildRetentionDays` is now configurable from `@aws-blocks/core`.** Previously
  `HostingProps` dropped it (only `retainOnDelete` was forwarded), so the only way
  to change retention was an L1 bucket override. It now flows through to the
  hosting bucket lifecycle rule. Must be at least `skewProtection.maxAge`
  (converted to days) or synth throws `InvalidSkewProtectionMaxAgeError`, as
  before.
  
  **New advisory guard.** An optional `storage.deployIntervalDays` hint emits a
  synth-time **warning** (never an error) when the deploy cadence is at or beyond
  `buildRetentionDays`, i.e. when superseded builds could age out before the next
  deploy and shrink the rollback window. The live build is unaffected, so this is
  a rollback-window note, not a correctness gate.
  
  Pre-1.0 `minor` per this repo's convention: the change alters the synthesized
  lifecycle rule and the `KvKeys` custom resource (a benign in-place bucket-config
  + Lambda-role update on the next deploy; no bucket replacement), and adds a new
  IAM grant (`s3:ListBucket` + `s3:PutObjectTagging` + `s3:DeleteObjectTagging`,
  scoped to `builds/*`) to the
  cutover handler. Build artifacts uploaded before the upgrade carry no
  `build-state` tag and are therefore never expired by the new rule — including
  the live build — so the upgrade cannot delete a running build; from the next
  deploy onward each superseded build is tagged and reclaimed normally.
- 46b7c89: Generate the local `aws-blocks` package's client entry point on fresh checkouts, under the correct export conditions.
  
  The templates declare `./client.js` as the package's `browser`/`import` entry and gitignore it as generated, so a scaffold built on any machine other than the one that scaffolded it failed to resolve the package, and `cdk synth` failed with it (the Hosting block builds the frontend during synthesis).
  
  `@aws-blocks/blocks` gains a `blocks-generate-client` bin (mirroring `blocks-generate-spec` and `blocks-vendorize`) that spawns the core generator worker with `--conditions=aws-runtime`, so the emitted client imports `aws-middleware` rather than `mock-middleware` regardless of how the hook is invoked. `@aws-blocks/core` exports the existing `generate-client-worker` subpath so the bin can resolve it. The templates wire `"prebuild": "blocks-generate-client"` (including `backend`, where the hook is dormant until a `build` script exists) and gitignore `.hosting/`, the Vite output written during synthesis.
- 2cb9d74: refactor(bb-agent): remove inert `structuredOutput` field from `AgentConfig`
  
  `AgentConfig` declared `structuredOutput?: z.ZodType`, but the field was never
  implemented, read, or consumed anywhere — no JSDoc, no consumer, no docs, no
  tests. It advertised a capability that does not exist, so setting it was a silent
  no-op. The declaration is removed (along with its line in the generated
  `API.md` report); no runtime behavior changes, because nothing ever read it.
  
  Structured output remains a planned future LLM-BB feature, tracked separately.
  This change only deletes the dead placeholder surface — it does not add or design
  any real structured-output support.
  
  This is a `minor` bump. Removing a property from an exported interface is a
  breaking change to the public type surface, but every package here is pre-1.0,
  where this repo's convention is that `minor` — not `major` — is the signal for a
  breaking or behavior-altering change (see the `maxLlmCalls`/`maxToolIterations`
  caps, which shipped as `minor` for exactly that reason). Practically the blast
  radius is a compile error only: code that set `structuredOutput` was already
  getting no-op behavior, so the error points at configuration that never did
  anything and the fix is to delete it. The umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets the
  same bump because it re-exports `AgentConfig`.

### Patch Changes

- fe0f04a: fix(blocks): drop `jobQueueUrl` from the `Agent` `getSdkIdentifiers` overload
  
  The Agent BB no longer runs its loop on an internal AsyncJob (it moved to a Bedrock AgentCore Runtime),
  so it no longer registers a `jobQueueUrl` identifier. The umbrella `getSdkIdentifiers(agent)` overload
  still declared it, promising a field that resolves to `undefined` at runtime. Remove it; the overload
  now returns only `conversationsTableName`, `messagesTableName`, `sessionBucketName`, `realtimeWsUrl`,
  and `realtimeCallbackUrl`.
- 585feea: Document AuthCognito setAuthState error-state semantics, including retriable challenge failures and CodeMismatch handling.
- 64ddd74: refactor(core): retarget the config registry to the shared role and every compute
  
  `finalizeConfigRegistry` no longer takes a single handler function. It now takes
  the owning construct plus the shared execution role and the stack's computes
  (`finalizeConfigRegistry(root, executionRole, computes)`) and:
  
  - grants `s3:GetObject` on the config object **once to the shared execution
    role** instead of to one function's role, so every compute that assumes the
    role can read it; and
  - stamps `BLOCKS_CONFIG_BUCKET` / `BLOCKS_CONFIG_KEY` on **every compute** via
    `compute.setEnv(...)` rather than on a single hardcoded handler.
  
  Adds a per-stack compute registry (`registerCompute` / `getComputes`): computes
  self-register on their owning stack in the `Compute` base constructor (state
  keyed on the stack, resolved via `cdk.Stack.of()`, like the config registry), so
  a multi-stack synth keeps each stack's computes isolated. `create()` reads the
  registry directly via `getComputes(stack)`.
  
  Behavior-preserving for the default single-compute app: the same config object
  is written to S3, the same two coordinates reach the runtime, and the same
  `s3:GetObject` permission is available — now via the shared role. Internal
  refactor; no public API or runtime-config-loading change.
- 165093b: `CronJob`: validate the schedule (and timezone) at synth so an invalid expression fails fast instead of after minutes of deploy.
  
  The CDK layer passed `schedule`/`timezone` straight into the EventBridge `CfnSchedule` with no validation, so an invalid expression — e.g. `rate(10 seconds)` (EventBridge's minimum is 1 minute) or a malformed `cron(...)` — passed `cdk synth` and was only rejected by EventBridge minutes into provisioning. The mock already validated these, so local dev and deploy diverged.
  
  The schedule parser and timezone check are now a shared `schedule` module used by both the mock and the CDK construct. `CronJob`'s constructor validates up front and throws `CronJobErrors.InvalidSchedule` / `CronJobErrors.InvalidTimezone` at synth, before any infrastructure is created.
  
  The synth gate is deliberately lenient for `cron(...)` — it checks the 6-field shape and defers field-level semantics (`L`/`W`/`#`, year fields, named days) to EventBridge — so it never rejects an advanced-but-valid schedule. The local mock, which must actually simulate the schedule, still can't model those forms; it now throws the new `CronJobErrors.ScheduleNotSupported` (rather than `InvalidSchedule`) for them, so local dev doesn't call a deployable schedule "invalid". No behavior change for valid, mock-supported schedules.
- 8de4a56: `DistributedTable` mock: order GSI sort-key ties deterministically to match DynamoDB.
  
  When a GSI sort key was shared by multiple items, the mock's `query` fell back to Map insertion order for the tied rows — so results depended on write order / disk-reload order and diverged from deployed behavior. The mock now tie-breaks on the base-table primary key (partition key, then sort key), matching DynamoDB's observed ordering for index rows with equal sort keys, and reverses the whole order (ties included) under `order: 'desc'`. AWS doesn't document a contractual guarantee for the tie order, so the mock is intentionally deterministic even where DynamoDB's contract is unspecified. No change for unique sort keys.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 08ab129: Add `pointInTimeRecovery: boolean | { retentionDays: number }` to `BlocksDefaults` (and to `BlocksPresets`: `true` in `production`, `false` in `sandbox`).
  
  This extends the stack-wide infrastructure-defaults posture with the continuous-backup knob, so a Building Block whose service supports it (DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery) can resolve its default from `scope.defaults.pointInTimeRecovery` — read independently, the same way as `removalPolicy` and `deletionProtection`. `true` enables backups with the service default window, `false` disables them, and `{ retentionDays: n }` pins the window (the block validates `n` against its service's range) — on/off and window are one field since a window only means anything when backups are on. Blocks whose service has no equivalent simply ignore it. `bb-distributed-table` is the first consumer.
  
  > The property **name** (`pointInTimeRecovery`) and its `{ retentionDays }` shape are a public `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` surface addition and want API-BR sign-off before release.

### Patch Changes

- 1ff9d03: `AppSetting`: support a customer-managed KMS key for secrets via `kmsKeyArn`.
  
  Secret (`SecureString`) parameters were always encrypted with the default `aws/ssm` AWS-managed key, so their decrypt scope couldn't be controlled (e.g. for cross-account access or a dedicated key policy). Passing `kmsKeyArn` (also accepted by `AppSetting.fromExisting`) now encrypts the secret with that customer-managed key:
  
  - the bulk-init Custom Resource creates the parameter with the CMK (`KeyId`);
  - the shared handler is granted `kms:Decrypt`/`Encrypt` scoped to that specific key ARN (instead of the `aws/ssm` `ViaService` wildcard);
  - the runtime `put()` re-specifies the key on overwrite so it doesn't silently fall back to `aws/ssm`;
  - adding/changing/removing `kmsKeyArn` on an already-deployed secret re-encrypts its current value under the new key at deploy time, so decryption keeps working after a key rotation.
  
  `kmsKeyArn` is only valid with `secret: true` and must be a non-empty ARN. The default (no `kmsKeyArn`) is unchanged.
- 5798492: feat(bb-async-job): batch SQS messages by default, with a configurable batching window
  
  `AsyncJob` triggered its Lambda with `batchSize: 1`, so every queued job cost a
  full invocation. The default is now `batchSize: 10` with a new
  `maxBatchingWindowSeconds` option (0–300, default 5) that trades latency for
  fuller batches. SQS partial batch failure reporting is always enabled, so only
  the failed records of a batch are redelivered.
  
  Both options are now range-checked in the `AsyncJob` constructor, so an
  out-of-range value fails fast at synth time with `InvalidOptionException` naming
  the option instead of surfacing as an opaque CloudFormation error mid-deploy:
  `batchSize` must be 1–10 without a batching window (1–10000 with one), and
  `maxBatchingWindowSeconds` must be 0–300.
  
  Retry semantics are unchanged. SQS tracks `ApproximateReceiveCount` per message
  and partial batch responses redeliver only failed records, so `maxRetries` still
  means "attempts for this message" and the DLQ `maxReceiveCount` keeps its
  meaning at any batch size.
  
  This is a `patch` bump. Every package here is pre-1.0, where a `minor` bump is
  this repo's signal for a breaking change; this change is not breaking — the new
  default is a behavior change with an opt-out (`batchSize: 1` /
  `maxBatchingWindowSeconds: 0`), and both options are new and optional. The
  umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets the same bump because it re-exports
  `AsyncJob` and `AsyncJobOptions`.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now exports `SHARED_HANDLER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, the shared
  handler Lambda's timeout, so resources that must size their own timeouts against
  it stop re-hardcoding `900`.
  
  The main queue's visibility timeout is now `SHARED_HANDLER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS + maxBatchingWindowSeconds`
  seconds instead of a flat `900`. A message becomes invisible when the poller
  receives it, before the batching window elapses and before the handler runs, so
  a flat 900s let SQS redeliver a message whose invocation was still running.
  
  `bb-agent` opts out of the new defaults with `batchSize: 1` and
  `maxBatchingWindowSeconds: 0`. It submits an internal job per interactive agent
  turn (plus a second on HITL resume) and the caller is blocked on that job
  starting, so a batching window would add up to 5s of latency to a human-facing
  path; `batchSize: 1` also keeps one failing turn from sharing a batch with
  others, which matters because the handler is not idempotent. Both the runtime
  and CDK construction sites set the same options so they synthesize an identical
  event source mapping.
- ca8cfb6: feat(bb-async-job): submitBatch auto-chunks batches larger than SQS limits
  
  `submitBatch` previously rejected any batch over 10 payloads with
  `BatchTooLarge`, so a caller with more than 10 jobs had to reimplement SQS's
  chunking rules by hand. It now accepts up to 10,000 payloads and packs them
  into `SendMessageBatch` requests bounded by both SQS per-request limits — at
  most 10 entries and at most 256 KB of aggregate message body — sent with
  bounded concurrency (at most 5 requests in flight) rather than one long serial
  loop. Each batch entry's `Id` is the payload's original index, so the returned
  `jobIds` stay in input order and every id is the same SQS `MessageId` that
  `getStatus()` / `waitUntilComplete()` look up. `BatchTooLarge` is now thrown
  only when a batch exceeds the 10,000-payload soft cap — a guardrail against a
  single call fanning out to an unbounded number of SQS requests.
  
  A batch spanning multiple chunks is **not atomic**: an earlier chunk can land
  before a later one fails. The all-or-nothing signal is unchanged — a partial
  failure still throws `BatchSubmitFailed` — but the thrown error (now a typed
  `BatchSubmitFailedError`) reflects the partial reality across all chunks:
  `.jobIds` carries the real `MessageId` for every entry that made it onto the
  queue (with `null` at each failed index) and `.failed[]` lists every failure
  sorted by index, so a caller can retry only the failed indexes instead of
  re-submitting the whole batch. Two failure kinds feed `.failed[]`: an
  entry-level rejection is scoped to its index, while a transport-level `send()`
  rejection (throttling, connection, auth) fails that whole chunk and
  short-circuits the chunks not yet started (`code: 'BatchSubmitAborted'`) instead
  of hammering an unhealthy endpoint. An entry SQS returns in neither list becomes
  a `MissingResult` failure so a `null` id never escapes as a success.
  
  On full success the `trackStatus` write is now best-effort — a failure recording
  `queued` (e.g. DynamoDB throttling on a large fan-out) is logged rather than
  thrown, since the handler backfills the record anyway; otherwise a bookkeeping
  error would make a caller re-submit an already-enqueued batch. `recordQueuedBatch`
  also issues its conditional writes in groups of 25 (mirroring `BatchWriteItem`)
  rather than one unbounded `Promise.all`.
  
  The mock runtime submits one message at a time and never partially fails, so the
  transport/abort paths are AWS-only; it enforces the same soft cap and validates
  every payload before enqueuing any, matching the AWS runtime.
  
  This is a `patch` bump: pre-1.0, this repo uses `minor` to signal a breaking
  change, and this is not breaking — a batch of ≤10 behaves exactly as before, no
  public type changed (`BatchSubmitFailedError` is additive), and the previous
  `BatchTooLarge` threshold simply moved from 10 to 10,000. `@aws-blocks/blocks`
  gets the same bump because it re-exports `AsyncJob`.
- f00adb0: feat(core): resolve `Scope.compute`; the default compute owns the handler + gateway
  
  Add a `Scope.compute` getter that resolves the compute a block runs on: the
  nearest `_compute` assigned on the block or an ancestor scope, else the owning
  stack/backend's default compute.
  
  The default is a `LambdaCompute` that now **owns** the Lambda function + API
  Gateway. `setupBlocksInfra` no longer creates them; `BlocksStack` /
  `BlocksBackend` expose `handler` / `gateway` / `apiUrl` as getters that delegate
  to the default compute. The compute is created in `create()` before the backend
  module is imported, so a block reading `this.compute` in its constructor
  resolves to it. `_compute` is internal (no public option yet).
  
  Core no longer imports a concrete compute: `create()` requires a
  `defaultComputeFactory` on its props (`CoreBlocksStackProps` /
  `CoreBlocksBackendProps` — the public `BlocksStackProps` / `BlocksBackendProps`
  plus that factory) and calls it to build the default. The umbrella
  `@aws-blocks/blocks` supplies `LambdaCompute` by spreading the factory onto the
  props in a thin `create()` wrapper, so apps built on `@aws-blocks/blocks` are
  unaffected — their call site is unchanged.
  
  **Breaking (direct `@aws-blocks/core` consumers only):** core no longer provides
  a built-in default compute. `BlocksStack.create()` / `BlocksBackend.create()`
  now require a `defaultComputeFactory` field on the props (typed
  `CoreBlocksStackProps` / `CoreBlocksBackendProps`); props without it no longer
  type-check (and it throws at synth if forced). This break is inherent to moving
  the Lambda + API Gateway out of core — it is not specific to how the factory is
  passed. Migrate by either:
  
  - using `@aws-blocks/blocks` (`import { BlocksStack } from '@aws-blocks/blocks/cdk'`),
    which injects a Lambda default for you — the recommended path; or
  - supplying your own factory on the props:
    `BlocksStack.create(scope, id, { ...props, defaultComputeFactory: (root) => new LambdaCompute(root, 'DefaultCompute') })`,
    which requires depending on `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute` and the internal
    `@aws-blocks/core/cdk/internal` types.
  
  **Resource replacement on redeploy:** because the Lambda function and API
  Gateway now live under the default compute's construct path
  (`.../DefaultCompute/...`), their CloudFormation logical IDs change, so a
  redeploy **replaces** the function + API Gateway and the API URL changes. These
  are internal resources, not a customer-facing contract. Any consumer with an
  already-deployed stack — in particular an Amplify Gen2 frontend wired to the
  current API Gateway URL (this repo carries a Gen2 nested-stack regression test,
  so Gen2 integration is real) — should confirm they can absorb a URL change
  before upgrading.
- de4f209: `KnowledgeBase.retrieve`: validate `maxResults` consistently across the mock and AWS runtimes.
  
  `maxResults` was normalized with `Math.min(Math.max(v ?? 10, 1), 100)`, which silently passed fractional and non-finite values (`1.5`, `NaN`, `Infinity`) straight through — the mock and the AWS `RetrieveCommand` then diverged, and Bedrock rejects a non-integer `numberOfResults`. A new shared `normalizeMaxResults` helper (used by both runtimes) keeps the documented clamp for finite integers and now rejects fractional/non-finite values up front with `KnowledgeBaseErrors.ValidationError`, before any search or Bedrock request.
  
  Fixes #430.
- f00adb0: `LambdaCompute`: default the function to **arm64 (AWS Graviton)**.
  
  The compute's Lambda now defaults to `Architecture.ARM_64` instead of CDK's `x86_64` default. arm64 Lambda is ~20% cheaper per GB-second than x86_64 at equivalent performance. Because `LambdaCompute` is the default compute for every `@aws-blocks/blocks` app, the shared handler runs on Graviton out of the box.
  
  The framework's own Building Blocks are pure-JavaScript esbuild bundles with no architecture-specific native code, so the switch is transparent for them. A backend `entry` bundle is the customer's own handler plus whatever they import, though — so an app that bundles an **x86-only native dependency** into its backend should be aware of the default. There is no per-app override yet; a customer-facing way to pin the architecture (`architecture` on `LambdaComputeProps` is present but internal for now) will be exposed alongside the public compute-configuration surface.
  
  > **Behavior change on next deploy:** the handler function's architecture is `arm64` (an in-place update on an existing function).
- 27346f3: Make AuthOIDC `requireAuth()` throw `ApiError(401, NotAuthenticatedException)` so the documented `handle401()` 401-redirect pattern works for a signed-out protected call.
  
  Previously `requireAuth()` threw a bare `Error` with no `status`. Over the JSON-RPC boundary `errorResponseFromCatch` serializes a non-`ApiError` as code `500`, so the client received an `ApiError` with `status === 500`. The README's `if (handle401(e, provider)) return;` helper only acts on `err instanceof ApiError && err.status === 401`, so it never matched and the app never redirected to sign-in — the error just surfaced. This aligns AuthOIDC with AuthCognito, whose `requireAuth()` already throws `ApiError(401, …)`. The error name is preserved, so existing `isBlocksError(e, AuthOIDCErrors.NotAuthenticated)` checks are unaffected.
- 5bfae0a: Reject oversized JSON-RPC request bodies at the shared parser. `parseRpcRequest` now caps the body at 10 MiB (`MAX_RPC_BODY_BYTES`, the same limit API Gateway enforces in production) and returns a `413` error named `PayloadTooLarge` before parsing or dispatch. In production API Gateway rejects an oversized body at the edge before the Lambda runs; enforcing the same limit at the parser means the local dev server rejects the same body instead of buffering it and wedging the local database (e.g. PGlite). Because both the Lambda handler and the dev server route through this one parser, the cap lives in a single place, and `decodeRpcResponse` surfaces it client-side as `ApiError.status === 413`.
- 0ac3879: `sandbox` / `deploy`: fail fast with an actionable message when AWS credentials are missing or expired.
  
  Both commands previously spent ~10 seconds synthesizing the CDK app before the first AWS call, so an unconfigured or expired credential surfaced only afterwards — as an opaque CDK/CloudFormation error that didn't name the real cause. `startSandbox` and `deploy` now run a bounded STS `GetCallerIdentity` check up front and, on a real credential error (missing/expired/invalid), exit immediately with guidance (`aws configure` / `aws sso login`, `AWS_PROFILE`, or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) instead of wasting the synth.
  
  The check is deliberately conservative: it only blocks on a genuine credential error (surfacing the SDK error *name*, never the raw message, which can embed an ARN/account id); a network or service error warns and lets the deploy proceed; and it skips (with a warning) when no region is set in `AWS_REGION` / `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`, rather than guessing a region in the wrong partition (GovCloud/China). The scaffolded `sandbox` template entrypoint now `.catch`es and exits cleanly, matching `deploy`, so the guidance prints without an unhandled-rejection stack trace.

### Patch Changes

- 448a47c: fix(bb-lambda-compute): add package metadata, prebuild, and pin dependency ranges
  
  Bring `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute`'s package.json in line with its siblings:
  
  - add the `repository` / `homepage` / `bugs` blocks. Without `repository.url`,
    provenance publishing fails with `E422 … "repository.url" is ""` because npm
    cannot match the package against the sigstore attestation's source repo;
  - add the `prebuild` version-generation script (`generate-version.mjs`);
  - pin `@aws-blocks/core` to `^0.2.0` instead of `*`, matching every other
    package.
  
  Also pin the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks`'s dependency on
  `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute` to `^0.2.0` instead of `*`, now that the package
  publishes a real version.

### Minor Changes

- 7b4c62d: Add infrastructure `defaults` chosen once at the app entry point, replacing the per-block `sandboxMode` logic and the `RemovalPolicies`/`SandboxDisableDeletionProtection` mixin dance for removal-policy and deletion-protection.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now exports `BlocksDefaults` and the `BlocksPresets.sandbox` / `BlocksPresets.production` starting points. `BlocksStack.create` / `BlocksBackend.create` take a required `defaults` prop; start from a preset and override individual fields with a spread. `defaults` is anchored on the owning `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` (resolved by walking up the construct tree, like `handler`/`executionRole`), so multiple backends in one stack each keep their own posture. Building Blocks read the resolved values via `scope.defaults`, and a per-block option always wins (`option ?? scope.defaults.field`).
  
  Adopted across the stateful Building Blocks: `bb-kv-store`, `bb-data`, `bb-distributed-data`, `bb-distributed-table`, and `bb-knowledge-base` now take their removal policy and deletion protection from `defaults` instead of reading the `sandboxMode` context themselves. (`bb-distributed-table` reads `defaults` directly for now; a richer per-block `protection` override lands with #282.)
  
  The `create-blocks-app` scaffolding templates are updated to pass `defaults: sandboxMode ? BlocksPresets.sandbox : BlocksPresets.production` (replacing the `RemovalPolicies`/`SandboxDisableDeletionProtection` mixin), so newly-generated apps satisfy the required prop.
  
  **Breaking:** `BlocksStack.create` / `BlocksBackend.create` now require a `defaults` field — pass `BlocksPresets.sandbox` or `BlocksPresets.production` (typically `sandboxMode ? BlocksPresets.sandbox : BlocksPresets.production`). The previously-shipped experimental `hardening` prop and its `resolve*` helpers are removed; log-retention, API throttling, access-logging and point-in-time-recovery move into `defaults` in follow-up, per-feature changes.

### Patch Changes

- 6df9e2d: fix(data): declare the `data-common` TypeScript project reference in `bb-data` and `bb-distributed-data`
  
  Both packages depend on `@aws-blocks/data-common` in `package.json`, but neither
  listed it in its `tsconfig.json` `references`. Because `src/` ships in these
  tarballs, `data-common`'s declarations have to already exist for the compiler to
  resolve `@aws-blocks/data-common` — and nothing in the project-reference graph
  guaranteed that.
  
  Correct build order was therefore supplied by the position of `data-common` in
  the root `workspaces` array (index 8, ahead of `bb-data` at 10 and
  `bb-distributed-data` at 11) rather than by the dependency graph. Any build that
  does not follow that array order fails with:
  
  ```
  packages/bb-distributed-data/src/validation.ts(12,54): error TS2307:
    Cannot find module '@aws-blocks/data-common' or its corresponding type declarations.
  ```
  
  That was already reachable from the repo's own scripts: the former
  `npm run build:packages` resolved its `-w` targets in a different order and hit
  exactly this, which is why `scripts/agent-bench/steps/1-init-bench-app.sh`
  carried the comment "`build:packages` runs alphabetically and trips over
  bb-data". Adding the two missing references fixes the root cause, so build order
  now comes from the project-reference graph rather than from the ordering of the
  root `workspaces` array.
  
  No API, runtime, or packaged-output change — `tsconfig.json` is not in either
  package's `files`, so the published tarballs are unchanged.
- 3614a09: Stop `import.meta.url` from crashing the deployed Lambda. The backend handler is bundled to CommonJS, where `import.meta` is empty, so `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` in a handler, a Building Block's `aws-runtime` code, or a dependency became `fileURLToPath(undefined)` and threw at Lambda load (every request 502'd). esbuild only warned, so the broken bundle deployed. The handler bundling now shims `import.meta.url` / `import.meta.dirname` / `import.meta.filename` to their CommonJS equivalents (`pathToFileURL(__filename)`, `__dirname`, `__filename`) — the approach esbuild blesses and Rollup applies by default — so the bundle loads cleanly and a dependency that merely contains `import.meta` no longer trips a build failure. Exposes `blocksNodejsBundling()` from `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` (re-exported by `@aws-blocks/blocks`) so every framework `NodejsFunction` gets the same treatment. Note: inside the bundle these resolve to the bundled output location, not your source tree.
- edbf1aa: fix(bb-knowledge-base): disable `installLatestAwsSdk` on the ingestion custom resource
  
  The `StartIngestion` `AwsCustomResource` left `installLatestAwsSdk` at its default
  (`true`), so the provider Lambda ran an `npm install` of the AWS SDK on every
  invocation before it could call the API. That costs roughly 15-30s of extra cold
  start and raises the shared provider Lambda to 512MB of memory, though that
  reduction is only realized once every `AwsCustomResource` in the stack opts out —
  the provider is a stack-level singleton and its `memorySize` is resolved once at
  synth. The per-resource cold-start saving applies regardless.
  
  Nothing needed it. The resource calls `BedrockAgent.startIngestionJob`, a stable
  API already bundled in the Lambda runtime's AWS SDK v3, so the bundled client is
  sufficient and the install is pure overhead. Setting `installLatestAwsSdk: false`
  also silences CDK's `installLatestAwsSdkNotSpecified` synth-time warning for this
  construct.
  
  The tradeoff being accepted: the provider now uses whichever SDK v3 the Lambda
  runtime bundles at deploy time rather than installing the newest one. That is safe
  here because `startIngestionJob` is a foundational Bedrock Agent operation present
  since the client's initial release, not a recent addition.
  
  Internal construct wiring only — no public API change. The synthesized
  `Custom::AWS` resource now renders `InstallLatestAwsSdk: false`.
  
  Upgrade note: because `InstallLatestAwsSdk` renders as a property on the
  `Custom::AWS` resource while the `physicalResourceId` stays stable, the first
  deploy after upgrading is a CloudFormation *Update* and fires `onUpdate` — so one
  `startIngestionJob` kicks off. This is harmless (ingestion is idempotent and
  fire-and-forget), but expect to see an ingestion start right after upgrading.
- 5262062: feat: extract `LambdaCompute` into `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute`
  
  The abstract `Compute` base stays in core as a framework primitive; the concrete
  `LambdaCompute` (a `NodejsFunction` fronted by its own API Gateway, assuming the
  shared execution role) moves into a new package, `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute`.
  
  The package is CDK-only and its sole export is internal — customers cannot
  instantiate a compute yet. Nothing in the default path constructs it, so this is
  additive and non-breaking.
- bfb9a63: Polish the PGlite init-retry helper (`data-common`) following #205 review:
  
  - Narrow the WASM-trap classifier to specific signatures (`RuntimeError: unreachable`, `wasm trap: unreachable`, Emscripten `Aborted(<reason>)`) instead of matching the bare word `unreachable`, so an unrelated probe failure whose text/stack merely contains "unreachable" (e.g. an `assertUnreachable` helper) is no longer misclassified as retryable. The `Aborted(` prefix (not just the empty `Aborted()`) is matched so memory-pressure aborts like `Aborted(Cannot enlarge memory arrays)` / `Aborted(OOM)` — the case this retry exists for — are caught. A `RuntimeError`-named error whose message contains `unreachable` is also treated as a trap, so the real V8/Node trap (message is literally `"unreachable"`, prefix only in the stack) is caught without depending on the stack surviving.
  - Classify retryability BEFORE consulting the attempt budget in `initializePgliteWithRetry`, so instance cleanup is uniform (a non-retryable error is always rethrown untouched) and `maxAttempts === 1` no longer closes the instance on a non-trap failure.
  - Guard `maxAttempts` against `NaN` (which `?? 3` does not default), preventing an unbounded close/recreate loop on a persistent trap.
  - Wrap a `recreate()` failure so the original init trap is preserved as the error `cause`, keeping debugging pointed at "PGlite kept trapping" rather than only the secondary recreate error.
  - Mark the four init-retry exports (`initializePgliteWithRetry`, `isPgliteUnreachableTrap`, `PgliteLike`, `PgliteInitRetryOptions`) `@internal` — they exist only so the engine packages can share the helper — and document the `PgliteLike` methods.
- e4b1498: Retry PGlite's WASM initialization on the intermittent `_pg_initdb` `unreachable` trap.
  
  PGlite defers `initdb` to the first query, which can trap with `unreachable` under memory pressure (notably on CI when several PGlite-backed dev servers boot concurrently) and kill the dev server mid-`runMigrations`. `PGliteEngine` (bb-data) and `DsqlMockEngine` (bb-distributed-data) now force initialization through a shared bounded retry (`initializePgliteWithRetry` in data-common) that closes the aborted WASM instance and boots a fresh one, so a transient init trap recovers instead of crashing the process.
- 8966cfb: fix(telemetry): detect Render and Taskcluster as CI
  
  Telemetry CI detection (`isCI()`) checked a fixed list of CI env vars but
  omitted Render and Taskcluster. Render sets `RENDER=true` on every build and
  service; Taskcluster tasks always set the namespaced `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL`.
  Runs on those platforms were therefore reported as real user sessions instead
  of `ci:true`, inflating user metrics. `RENDER` and `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL` are
  now included in both `isCI()` implementations (`@aws-blocks/core` and
  `@aws-blocks/create-blocks-app`). The umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets a patch
  bump because it re-exports `@aws-blocks/core`.

### Patch Changes

- 1e37c67: docs: per-block docs folders + committed BB catalog with CI sync check; CLAUDE/agents docs resolved via require.resolve

  `@aws-blocks/blocks` now ships one docs folder per Building Block under `docs/<block>/`
  (`README.md` / `API.md` / `DESIGN.md`), plus a committed, marker-delimited Building Block
  catalog in the package README that a `sync-docs --check` CI gate keeps in sync. The README's
  catalog section and the scaffolded `AGENTS.md` (`@aws-blocks/create-blocks-app`) now direct
  tools and agents to locate docs programmatically via
  `require.resolve('@aws-blocks/blocks/docs/<block>/README.md')` (and
  `require.resolve('@aws-blocks/blocks/docs/README.md')` for the catalog) rather than assuming a
  `node_modules/` path or following the human-facing relative links. Also adds a Security
  Considerations section to the package README.

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 75f5446: Add optional `fallback` parameter to `AuthenticatedContent` for rendering alternative content when the user is not authenticated.
- 2ed4177: Add stable `data-testid` hooks to the auth UI components so e2e suites can target the shipped `Authenticator` instead of forking it. Covers every interactive element (field inputs, hidden ones included, and submit buttons) plus the containers worth asserting against: the root, per-action wrappers, heading, error, the signed-in marker, `AuthenticatedContent`, and `AccountMenuBar`. Presentational markup such as hint text and layout wrappers stays unhooked. The full selector contract, including the `<action>:<provider>` form federated actions produce, is documented in CUSTOMIZING-AUTH-UI.md.

  The `@aws-blocks/blocks` umbrella package receives a `patch` because it re-exports these components from `@aws-blocks/auth-common/ui`. Sibling patch releases stay inside the umbrella's caret ranges, so `changeset version` never bumps it on its own (#212), and it is republished explicitly to stay in step with the components it hands to consumers.

- 5b2aede: `DistributedTable`: reconcile reads with the schema via a new `readValidation` mode (default `'coerce'`).

  **Behavioral change to the read path (preview).** Writes always validated against `schema`, but reads (`get`, `getBatch`, `query`, `scan`) returned the raw stored value. After a schema change, a row written under the old schema no longer conformed to type `T`: a newly added field was absent from the read (so the value silently violated `T`, and a `.default()` was never applied or persisted on write-back), and a required-no-default field made the read-modify-write cycle (`get()` → mutate → `put()`) throw `ValidationFailed`.

  Reads now reconcile stored items with the schema via `readValidation?: 'off' | 'coerce' | 'strict'`:

  - **`'coerce'`** (default) — apply the schema (fill defaults, narrow types) so legacy rows conform to `T` and round-trip cleanly, **without dropping data**: the coerced output is deep-merged over the raw stored item, so attributes not in the current schema (older-schema fields, columns another writer owns) are preserved rather than silently stripped on a read-modify-write. Arrays are replaced wholesale. On a value that can't be coerced, return the raw value + log a warning — **never throws**.
  - **`'strict'`** — throw `ValidationFailed` on any non-conforming item (opt-in; treats a mismatch as corruption).
  - **`'off'`** — return the raw stored value with no validation (the previous default behavior).

  ```ts
  const orders = new DistributedTable(scope, "orders", {
    schema: orderSchemaV2, // adds `currency: z.string().default('USD')`
    key: { partitionKey: "orderId" },
    // readValidation: 'coerce' is the default
  });
  const order = await orders.get({ orderId: "o1" }); // legacy row → currency: 'USD'
  await orders.put({ ...order, total: 20 }); // conforms to T; round-trips
  ```

  Migration note: the default is now `'coerce'` (previously reads returned raw values). Pass `readValidation: 'off'` to restore raw reads. Coercion is best-effort and validator-dependent — transform-bearing schemas (e.g. Zod) fill defaults and narrow types; check-only Standard Schema validators pass values through unchanged. `null` (a missing item) is untouched in all modes.

- feb5be4: Re-export the `auth.admin` types (`AdminOptions`, `AdminUser`, `AdminCreateInit`, `GroupAdmin`, `LifecycleAdmin`, `AdminSurface`, `AdminGetterOf`, `AdminDisabled`) from the umbrella package so consumers using `@aws-blocks/blocks` can name the values `auth.admin` returns and annotate `admin` options.
- 9de27dd: fix(core): stream CloudFormation progress to stdout and stop a stray SIGTERM from killing an in-flight deploy

  `npm run deploy` wrote nothing to stdout for the whole CloudFormation phase, and
  a backgrounded deploy was killed (exit 143) while CloudFormation kept going and
  finished server-side. Callers had no progress signal, could not tell success from
  failure, and re-ran deploys that had actually worked.

  Two causes, both fixed:

  - The CDK CLI picks its log stream as `isCI ? stdout : stderr`, so every
    CloudFormation event went to stderr and `npm run deploy > deploy.log` captured
    zero bytes. The deploy now passes `--ci` (log lines on stdout, errors still on
    stderr) and `--progress events` (one line per resource transition instead of a
    progress bar that needs a TTY).
  - The deploy ran `cdk deploy` through a blocking synchronous spawn with the child
    in this process's group, so signals could not be handled and the default
    SIGTERM disposition killed the CLI mid-deploy. The CDK CLI is now spawned in
    its own process group with its output piped and relayed line by line as it
    arrives, plus an idle heartbeat while a slow resource is converging. A single
    SIGTERM, or any SIGHUP, no longer abandons a converging deploy: it logs and
    keeps streaming. Ctrl-C, or a second SIGTERM, aborts and reaps the CDK process
    tree. Repeat deliveries of the same signal inside the coalescing window log one
    line instead of one per delivery.

  Worth knowing before you upgrade:

  - **The signal resilience is POSIX-only.** It needs process groups (`detached` is
    passed only when `process.platform !== 'win32'`) and real signal delivery, and
    Windows has neither: nothing outside the process delivers SIGTERM/SIGHUP there,
    so a kill on the process tree still ends the deploy and the abort path reaps by
    pid. Streaming, the heartbeat and the `--ci` argv apply on every platform.
  - **The `❌ Deployment failed.` banner moved from stderr to stdout**
    (`console.error` → `console.log`), so a caller capturing only stdout can tell a
    failed deploy from a killed process. Anything grepping _stderr_ for that exact
    string will no longer match it. The failure _reason_ has not moved: the CDK CLI
    keeps error-level output on stderr even under `--ci`, and the deploy entrypoint
    still prints the error itself with `console.error`, so stderr remains the place
    to grep for why a deploy failed. Both halves of that split are now covered by
    tests, including one against the real CDK CLI.

- 58f77dd: Document four things people were reverse-engineering from compiled output.

  - **Runtime config resolution.** The client config is served at the dotted path `/.blocks-sandbox/config.json`; `/config.json` is not a route, so a 404 there means nothing. `{"_placeholder":true}` in the frontend build output is the Hosting construct's synth-time stub (the real `apiUrl` is still an unresolved CloudFormation token), so it is expected pre-deploy rather than a broken config. Covers the resolution order, what each environment should actually return, and what a genuine failure looks like.
  - **`RawRoute`.** Full section in the core README: constructor signature, a `GET` example that sets status, `Content-Type` and body, what you can read off `ctx.request` and write to `ctx.response`, path/parameter/wildcard syntax, and the registration rules (reserved paths, duplicate routes, register-during-load). Also added a "serve a raw HTTP endpoint" entry to the block catalog decision tree, which had no pointer to it.
  - **Server-initiated OIDC sign-in.** New section in the `bb-auth-oidc` README for `GET /aws-blocks/auth/signin/<provider>`: the redirect chain through the IdP and the callback, the pending-auth and session cookies, the JSON error shape, a runnable `curl` walkthrough, when to use it instead of the client PKCE API, and a pointer to the integration tests that assert each response. One route is mounted per configured provider, so an undeclared provider name 404s instead of reporting `ProviderNotConfiguredException`, which comes from `getSignInUrl()`.
  - **Error and RPC semantics.** `ApiError`'s constructor arguments (including `cause` staying server-side and `retriable`), how its `status` becomes the JSON-RPC error code and decodes back into an `ApiError` on the client, `hasAuthError`'s signature and when it applies instead of `isBlocksError`, how `params` is read as positional args vs a named object, that a top-level JSON array body (a batch) is rejected with `-32600`, and that `broadcastAuthChange` comes from `@aws-blocks/blocks/ui` rather than the package root.

  Docs only, plus tests locking in the documented `ApiError`, `params` and batch-rejection behaviour, and the documented `404`s on the OIDC sign-in and sign-out routes.

- b83aaba: Add opt-in TTL support to `KVStore` and use it to expire `AuthCognito` session records.

  `KVStore` gains a `ttl` construct option that enables DynamoDB Time-to-Live on the table, plus per-write expiry via `put(key, value, { ttlSeconds })` or `{ expiresAt }`. Both default to off, so existing tables and every existing `put()` call are unaffected. Because DynamoDB deletes expired items asynchronously, `get` and `scan` also filter expired items on read in every runtime, and the local mock emulates the same expiry semantics. Maintenance sweeps that need to act on rows the reaper has not collected yet can opt out with `scan({ includeExpired: true })`.

  `AuthCognito` now enables TTL on its sessions table and stamps each session write with `now + sessionTtlSeconds`. Session records store live Cognito refresh tokens, so without an expiry the table grew without bound and retained those credentials at rest indefinitely; abandoned sessions are now reaped automatically. Authorization is unchanged — validity is still decided by token revalidation on every request.

  Two things to know before upgrading:

  - **Your next `cdk deploy` enables TTL on the existing sessions table.** Even though this is a patch, `AuthCognito` now passes `{ ttl: true }`, so the deploy issues a one-time `UpdateTimeToLive` against the live table. That is an online, non-disruptive DynamoDB operation — no downtime, no data loss — but it is a mutation of a live resource, so it shouldn't surprise anyone diffing a patch upgrade.
  - **Only sessions written after the upgrade expire.** A missing `ttl` attribute means "never expires" (matching DynamoDB), and existing rows are not backfilled, so sessions created before the upgrade keep their refresh tokens at rest indefinitely. Backfilling would need a one-time migration writing `ttl` onto every existing row. To close the retention gap immediately, revoke the pre-existing sessions instead — the revoke sweep deletes rows regardless of expiry state.

- f583c75: Add opt-in job status tracking to AsyncJob

  Pass `trackStatus: true` and AsyncJob records each job's lifecycle, which you can read with two new methods:

  - `getStatus(jobId)` returns the job's current state plus every state it has passed through.
  - `waitUntilComplete(jobId, options?)` waits until the job reaches `complete` or `failed`, with `timeoutMs`, `pollIntervalMs`, and `AbortSignal` support.

  Transitions are appended rather than overwritten, so intermediate states stay observable no matter when you read them. A handler that finishes in a millisecond still records that it went through `processing`, and a caller that checks once after the job settled sees the whole sequence. That removes the need to pad a handler with an artificial delay just to make the `processing` state catchable, and a retry appends another `processing` entry so attempt counts are visible too.

  Appends are guarded by a compare-and-swap, so the two ways two writers can hold the same record at once cannot drop a transition: a `queued` write arriving after SQS already delivered the message, and a duplicate delivery of the same message on an at-least-once queue.

  When the handler gets there first it creates the record itself, dating the submission from the moment it first saw the job, since that is all it knows. The `queued` write that arrives afterwards replaces that placeholder with the real submission time instead of dropping it, so `submittedAt` and the first transition always report when the job was submitted rather than when it started being processed.

  Enabling the flag provisions one DynamoDB table for the job's status records, with a 24 hour TTL, and adds a write on submit plus one per state change. Leave it off and nothing is provisioned; `submit()` stays a single SQS call and the status methods throw `StatusNotTracked`.

  Status writes on the handler path are logged rather than thrown, so bookkeeping can never retry work that succeeded or mask work that failed. The trade is that a dropped terminal write leaves a finished job without a terminal state, so read `waitUntilComplete()`'s `Timeout` as "status unknown" rather than "still running".

- 3c56267: `AuthBasic` and `Logger` now report `bbName`/`bbVersion` to `Scope`, so they appear in telemetry like every other Building Block.

  Both were listed in the umbrella's `aws-blocks.vendorize` map, so `scripts/generate-bb-names.mjs` had already generated them into `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES` — but neither passed `bbMeta` to `super()`, and `Scope` only records a block in its registry when `bbName` is set. Their entries in that set were therefore inert: `Scope.getRegisteredBlocks()` could never name either block, so `product.buildingBlocks` under-reported two of the most widely used blocks. Each package now carries the standard `prebuild` (`generate-version.mjs AuthBasic` / `Logger`), which generates the `BB_NAME`/`BB_VERSION` its constructor passes through — the same wiring the other blocks use.

  `Logger` is composed internally by most other blocks (`new Logger(this, 'logger', { level: 'error' })`), so it will now be reported for effectively every application, and `totalCount` rises accordingly. That is the intended reading of the existing `Logger` entry in the vendorize map, not a new disclosure: `getRegisteredBlocks()` still exposes only names already on the official list, and customer-chosen block names remain counted-but-unnamed.

  `@aws-blocks/blocks` takes a `patch` because it re-exports both blocks; sibling releases stay inside its caret range, so `changeset version` would not bump it on its own (#273, #212). `@aws-blocks/core` needs no bump — both names were already present in the generated `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES`, so that file is byte-identical.

- 0491157: `Metrics`, `Tracer`, and `DistributedDatabase` now report `bbName`/`bbVersion` to `Scope`, so they appear in telemetry like every other Building Block.

  All three were listed in the umbrella's `aws-blocks.vendorize` map, so `scripts/generate-bb-names.mjs` had already generated them into `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES` — but none passed `bbMeta` to `super()`, and `Scope` only records a block in its registry when `bbName` is set. Their entries in that set were therefore inert: `Scope.getRegisteredBlocks()` could never name them, so `product.buildingBlocks` under-reported them. Each package now carries the standard `prebuild` (`generate-version.mjs Metrics` / `Tracer` / `DistributedDatabase`), which generates the `BB_NAME`/`BB_VERSION` its constructor passes through — the same wiring the other blocks use.

  `bb-tracer` and `bb-distributed-data` ship distinct mock implementations (their default entry does not re-export the AWS class), so both `index.aws.ts` and `index.mock.ts` carry the change; `bb-metrics`'s mock re-exports the AWS class, so its single runtime change covers both conditions. CDK entry points are deliberately left alone — telemetry is reported by the runtime class, not the synth-time construct.

  This is a follow-up to #298 (`AuthBasic`/`Logger`), completing telemetry parity for every vendorized block whose runtime class extends `Scope`. `@aws-blocks/blocks` takes a `patch` because it re-exports all three; sibling releases stay inside its caret range, so `changeset version` would not bump it on its own. `@aws-blocks/core` needs no bump — all three names were already present in the generated `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES`, so that file is byte-identical.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 0f3c73c: Reject `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN` at dev time, including the keyword-less Postgres shorthand (`ALTER TABLE t DROP col` / `DROP IF EXISTS col`). It is not in DSQL's supported `ALTER TABLE` subset ("unsupported ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN statement", 0A000), but the PGlite-based local mock previously accepted it, so the error only surfaced on deploy. Migration and mock validation now fail locally instead. The supported forms — `ALTER COLUMN ... DROP DEFAULT` / `DROP NOT NULL` / `DROP EXPRESSION` / `DROP IDENTITY` and `DROP CONSTRAINT` — are not affected.

  The `@aws-blocks/blocks` umbrella package receives a `patch` because its published `docs/` folder is assembled from sibling block READMEs at build time (`scripts/sync-block-docs.mjs`), so this `bb-distributed-data` README update changes `@aws-blocks/blocks` packaged content.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 09b94b8: Bump the Database block's Aurora PostgreSQL engine version from the retired `16.4` to `16.13`, and make the engine version configurable.

  AWS retired Aurora PostgreSQL `16.4` in us-east-1, after which `CreateDBCluster` failed with `Cannot find version 16.4 for aurora-postgresql`, blocking every deployment of a `Database` block. The default now points at the latest available `16.x` minor (`16.13`) for the longest deprecation runway.

  A new optional `postgresVersion` option on `DatabaseOptions` lets callers override the engine version (e.g. `postgresVersion: '16.13'`), so the next AWS retirement is a configuration change rather than a framework code fix. Overrides are validated at synth time (must be `MAJOR.MINOR`, e.g. `16.13`), so a malformed value fails fast with a clear error instead of an opaque `CreateDBCluster` failure.

  The `@aws-blocks/blocks` umbrella package receives a `patch` because its published `docs/` folder is assembled from sibling block READMEs at build time (`scripts/sync-block-docs.mjs`), so this `bb-data` README update changes `@aws-blocks/blocks` packaged content.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b6fb281: Add `isSynced()` / `waitUntilSynced()` ingestion-sync API to KnowledgeBase.

  Bedrock ingestion runs asynchronously after deploy, so during the initial pre-sync window `retrieve()` returns an empty array even for queries that would later match — making "empty" ambiguous between "not yet synced with your latest data" and "synced, no match". The new methods resolve that ambiguity (mirroring Bedrock's own "Sync" / "sync with your latest data" terminology):

  - `isSynced(): Promise<boolean>` — `true` once the data source's most recent ingestion job is `COMPLETE`; `false` while it is not yet synced with your latest data. This reports data _freshness_, not availability — `retrieve()` is always callable and serves the prior synced snapshot during a re-ingestion. Both local-folder and imported `s3://` sources register a BB-managed data source, so both are tracked (the "no managed data source → synced" shortcut applies only to deployments predating this API, which have no data source id injected). Throws a typed `IngestionFailedException` (including `failureReasons`) if the latest job failed.
  - `waitUntilSynced(options?: { timeoutMs?: number; pollIntervalMs?: number; maxConsecutiveTransientErrors?: number; signal?: AbortSignal }): Promise<void>` — polls until synced (defaults: `timeoutMs` 300000, `pollIntervalMs` 5000, `maxConsecutiveTransientErrors` 3), throwing a typed `KnowledgeBaseTimeoutException` on timeout or propagating `IngestionFailedException` on a failed job. Up to `maxConsecutiveTransientErrors` _consecutive_ transient control-plane errors are tolerated (the counter resets on a clean poll); terminal errors short-circuit immediately. Transient covers both throttling / transient network failures **and** a _not-yet-visible_ knowledge base — during the post-deploy window the control plane can briefly return `ResourceNotFoundException` (the freshly-created KB/data source hasn't propagated yet), which is ridden out rather than treated as terminal; a _missing-KB config_ error (`KB_ID` unset) stays terminal. The poll interval carries ±20% jitter (only the delay between polls varies, never the poll count or the deadline) so many KBs don't poll in lockstep. Pass an optional `signal` (`AbortSignal`) to cancel the wait — checked before each poll and during the inter-poll delay — which rejects with the signal's abort reason (default: a `DOMException` named `'AbortError'`).

  Purely additive — `retrieve()` and all existing signatures are unchanged. The local mock reports synced immediately (no async ingestion window in local dev).

  The umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package now also re-exports the new `WaitUntilSyncedOptions` type (alongside the existing `KnowledgeBase` re-exports) from both its runtime and CDK entry points, so consumers importing from `@aws-blocks/blocks` can reference it directly.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 1da34f1: fix(auth): propagate the structured error name through `setAuthState()`

  The recommended client auth path is `createApi()` → `setAuthState()`. When an
  action failed, `setAuthState()` caught the thrown `ApiError` and returned an
  `AuthState` carrying only `error: e.message`, discarding the structured
  `e.name` (e.g. `'InvalidCredentialsException'`). Because `AuthState` had no
  field for an error name, a hand-rolled client could not branch on error type
  (e.g. "try sign-in, fall back to sign-up for a brand-new user") without
  brittle string-matching the human-facing message.

  `AuthState` now carries an optional `errorName`, and the `bb-auth-basic` and
  `bb-auth-cognito` `setAuthState` implementations populate it from the thrown
  `ApiError.name` (skipping the generic `'ApiError'` default). A new
  `hasAuthError(state, name)` type guard in `@aws-blocks/core` lets clients
  branch on the returned state — `isBlocksError` only matches thrown `Error`
  instances, so it cannot be used on the plain `AuthState` object. Rule of
  thumb: throw path → `isBlocksError`; returned `AuthState` → `hasAuthError`.

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.

- 7fd51e0: fix(bb-auth-cognito): discriminate `SignInResult` on a string `status` field

  `SignInResult` (from `signIn` / `confirmSignIn` / `autoSignIn`) now discriminates
  on a string `status` (`'signedIn' | 'continueSignIn'`) instead of the `isSignedIn`
  boolean, so native-client codegen (Swift / Kotlin / Dart) emits clean, named,
  switch-decoded variants. Narrow with `if (result.status === 'signedIn')`.

  Breaking change to the `SignInResult` shape (pre-release): `isSignedIn` is removed,
  not aliased.

This gives humans and AI agents a single, stable path to all block documentation — `node_modules/@aws-blocks/blocks/docs/` — instead of scattering them across 19+ individual package paths.

  - `@aws-blocks/blocks`: adds `docs/` to the published package (assembled at build time via `scripts/sync-block-docs.mjs`). README expanded to be a comprehensive guide (architecture, workflow, best practices, common mistakes).
  - `@aws-blocks/create-blocks-app`: AGENTS.md templates updated to point to the blocks README and docs folder as the canonical entry points.
