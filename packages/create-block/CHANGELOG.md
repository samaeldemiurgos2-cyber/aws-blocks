# @aws-blocks/create-block

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- d4b32f2: Add `README.md` and `DESIGN.md` to `@aws-blocks/create-block` and ship them in the published package (`files`), matching the first-party package convention.
  
  Tidy two `extract-ts-types` test nits (test/comment only, no runtime change): replace a redundant re-assert with a direct check of the documented lingering-bare-key behavior, and link the array/tuple & nested-destructuring boundary to its tracking issue (#552).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a4ee47e: Add `@aws-blocks/create-block` — a scaffolder for new Building Blocks.
  
  `npm create @aws-blocks/block@latest <ClassName>` (or `npm run new:bb` inside this repo) generates a complete `bb-*` package: the conditional-export layers (`index.mock/aws/cdk/browser.ts` + `types.ts`/`errors.ts`), `README.md`/`DESIGN.md`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `api-extractor.json`, and passing `node:test` suites (behavior, export parity, and CDK synth). It scaffolds a **primitive** block — a storage-agnostic `Scope` skeleton with an example method and `TODO`s to fill in (composite and client-facing shapes can follow in a later release).
  
  The CLI auto-detects its context:
  
  - **Contributor mode** (run inside the aws-blocks monorepo): also wires the block into `@aws-blocks/blocks` (runtime + CDK re-exports, dependency, and vendorize map, via idempotent HTML markers), the root `workspaces`, the `comprehensive` test app, and a changeset; then regenerates the README catalog via `sync-docs`.
  - **Customer mode** (run inside your own npm-workspaces repo): generates `packages/bb-<name>`, registers it in your root `workspaces` (unless an existing glob like `packages/*` already covers it), and `npm install`s so your app can `import` it with no publish step. Does not modify your app's `package.json` or source. The npm scope is derived from your root package name (or `--scope`).
  - **External mode** (run anywhere else): generates a standalone `@<scope>/bb-<name>` package tagged `keywords: ["aws-blocks"]` with a self-contained build, no workspace wiring.
  
  Zero runtime dependencies (Node stdlib only). Flags: `--dir`, `--scope`, `--yes`, `--skip-install`, `--skip-verify`, `--dry-run`.

### Patch Changes

- b49fdd9: chore(create-block): add the `aws-blocks` keyword for npm discoverability
  
  `@aws-blocks/create-block` was published without a `keywords` array, so it did
  not appear in `npm search keywords:aws-blocks`, the discovery path the
  publishing guide documents (#491). This adds the `aws-blocks` keyword, which
  also satisfies the `keywords-guard.ts verify-discovery-tag` CI check that was
  failing on every PR because of this gap.
